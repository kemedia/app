Welcome to KE Stream! New update as there were some minor changes. Please close KE Media Center and click on KE Updater.

Version 0.22
1. Removed visual widgets from system, family and music sections to enchance performance

On a side note, do to the nature of live tv via internet, links may go down. I recommend either using the apps outside of the media center or signing up for a premium tv service.

For premium TV service (over 400+ channels) please contact EJ for details. 

Have a Great day!
