Due to recent news of developers quitting, there are a lot of addons that are not working. We added a new update to keep up with the fast pace changes. We will be rolling out updates often so when a popup like occurs, we advise you to update.

Please click on "Quit" and click on  "KE Updater" on main menu. After update, allow images and thumbnails to load.

Version 0.5

  2. Minor bug fixes 

Have a Great day!
