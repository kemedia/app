Welcome to KE Stream! There is a new update. If you have not done so, please properly close the KE Media Center and click on KE Updater. 

Some changes were:
1. Removed dead addons; removed some links from family and live tv section. 
2. Added new submenus on Family section. 
2. Changes to layout

On a side note, do to the nature of live tv via internet, links may go down. I recommend either using the apps outside of the media center or signing up for premium tv service.

For premium TV service (over 400+ channels) please contact EJ for details. 

Have a Great day!
